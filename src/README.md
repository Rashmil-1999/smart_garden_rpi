# Smart Garden Project

## Abstract

A regular maintenance schedule and physical access are key requirements for the proper upkeep of house plants. As observed over the past two years, in which the pandemic and other factors have limited our access to places of work and dramatically rearranged our daily routines, our increasingly remote and irregular schedules have interfered with the ability of plant owners to satisfy these requirements. One of the fundamental objectives of this project is to cater to those who desire to have plants in their homes or offices, but because of their busy and irregular schedules donâ€™t indulge in home gardening activities. This project will harnesses the potential of the Hasura GraphQL Engine, Raspberry Pi, various sensors, and a state-of-the-art RFID-based moisture sensing system to build a smart garden.
  
This IoT System will enable the user to remotely access, automatically irrigate, and ensure that house plants are getting an appropriate amount of (artificial) sunlight. Further, this application will provide updates on current system status, notify the user of potential system issues, provide graphical representations of the data collected from various sensors, and allow users to obtain information on the ideal requirements of different plants. This project uses a web-app built in React JS which can be installed on an android phone, granting the users the ability to access the system at their fingertips.

This repository contains the code that resides on Raspberry Pi deployed in the garden.
